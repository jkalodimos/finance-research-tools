Finance Research Tools
======================

This is a central repository for tools used in academic finance and accounting research.  The intent is: 

1. To have a permanant reference for accounting metrics, natural experiments, and standard ways to measure economic quantities of interest.
2. To aggregate pieces of code in various programming languages that will facilitate finance and accounting research.
